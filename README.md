# Short-circuit Performance of a Synchronverter-Based Microgrid

The paper associated with this work has been accepted for publication in IEEE Latin America Transactions (Submission ID: 9238). 

The base case from which the simulations of the experiments proposed in the article are generated is presented. 

## Content 
* **fault_tesis_1_SG**: Matlab script that links to the microgrid built in Simulink, which only needs to be run. It is important to note that 3 simulations are performed as 3 fault trigger times are assigned.
  
*  **ClusterMG_1_SG**: Simulink file containing the proposed microgrid and synchronverter model.

## Instructions for performing the experiments
To perform the experiments, it is only necessary to run the script in Matlab, as it automatically links to the file in Simulink. It is important that the name assigned in the script is the same as the name of the file in Simulink.
